# Android Studio Sandbox and App W.I.P.

I have been using this project as a way to learn how to implement particular features in Android Studio.
So far I have made a basic calculator, a step counter using Android's activity API, and a timer that can run while the app is closed.
Currently, I am working on implementing a spedometer using a phone's GPS data.
The end goal is to make an idle game that uses steps and a phone's movement to gain experience in the game and level up a character.
